To run Battleship:
1. Run server.py
2. Run two instances of server_battleship.py
3. In each instance, select 1: Register Account. The password is automatically stored for now ('pswd').
4. For each instance, select 2: Log In. Enter one of the registered names. The password is automatically input
   for now ('pswd').
5. For each instance, select 3: Play Game. Enter the name of the other registered player.
6. Once both have selected to Play Game against each other, it will prompt the users to enter their boat locations.
   You can pick a starting point of A1 (top left) to J10 (bottom right). (NOTE: The y-axis is A-J, starting at the top.
   The x-axis is 1-10, starting at the left.) Then you will choose H for Horizontal (the boat will be placed horizontal
   to the right of your selected cell) or V for Vertical (the boat will be placed vertical going downwards of your
   selected cell). When placing more than one boat, boats may not overlap. The program already checks for valid starting
   points and placements.
7. Once both users have placed their boats, the program will choose a beginning player.
8. Right now, the opponent's gameboard is shown WITH the boats and their positions (for testing). The player whose turn
   it is, is asked to fire a shot (A1 - J10). The program checks for the results and updates the appropriat gameboards
   for both clients.
9. The turn ends and it is the other player's turn.
10. Steps 8-9 will repeat until there is a winner.
11. A winning message is shown and the user is asked to hit enter to continue.
12. The application is restarted and the main menu is shown again.
